-- Grab an RPM from stdin and convert it into a chunked conduit of ByteStrings.  This could
-- just as easily come from a stdin (using stdinC) or over the network (see httpSink in
-- the http-conduit package, for instance).
--
-- Important note:  stdinC produces a conduit of multiple ByteStrings.  A single ByteString
-- is some chunk of the file - I don't know how much, but it feels like maybe 32k.  conduit calls
-- this chunked data, and while chunks are more efficient for conduit to work with, they don't do
-- much for us.  To examine the RPM header, we need individual bytes.  Luckily, the *CE functions
-- out of conduit let us get at individual elements out of the stream of chunks without even
-- having to think about a chunk or asking for more.  That all happens for us.
--
-- Long story short, chunks are useful for when we need to just pipe lots of data from one place
-- to another or when we need to tell conduit about types.  Elements are useful for when we need
-- to do something to the contents.
